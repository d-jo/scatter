# Scatter

Scatter is an encrypted message distribution system designed for low profile communication.

Scatter uses manifest files to point to fragmented data hidden in normal content. Thee fragmented data is reconstructed into data (normally an encrypted message), which is then decoded using an agreed-upon algorithm. Scatter can support custom retrival/decoding schemes by extending the source.
